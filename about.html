      <h2>About the Booster Club</h2>
      <p>The Segerstrom Football Booster Club is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization run by dedicated parent volunteers. Our goal is to support the Segerstrom High School football program by raising funds, organizing events, and providing essential resources for the teams and coaches.</p>
      <p>We work closely with school administration and coaching staff to ensure a positive experience for all student-athletes. Our efforts make it possible to fund team meals, purchase uniforms and equipment, and organize team events and celebrations throughout the year.</p>
      <p>All parents of players are welcome to participate, and we encourage the community to get involved as well. Together, we make a difference on and off the field!</p>
